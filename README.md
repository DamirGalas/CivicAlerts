# üèôÔ∏è CivicAlerts

## Overview
**CivicAlerts** is an event-driven system for reporting and tracking city incidents ‚Äî such as broken streetlights, road damage, pollution, or traffic issues.  
Citizens and city departments can report incidents, while other services (notifications, analytics, dashboards) react asynchronously through a message bus (**NATS**).  

This project demonstrates **CQRS**, **event-driven communication**, and **modular microservice architecture** using **C#**, **.NET**, and **NATS**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

### 1. Report Incident
- Users can report new incidents via REST API:  
  `POST /api/incidents`
- Each incident includes:
  - `Title` *(string, required)*
  - `Description` *(string, optional)*
  - `Category` *(e.g., Lighting, Road Damage, Pollution)*
  - `Location` *(coordinates or address)*
  - `Reporter` *(user name or ID)*
- Once created, the service publishes an **`IncidentReported`** event to **NATS**.

---

### 2. Change Incident Status
- City staff can update an incident‚Äôs status (`Reported ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved`).  
- Endpoint:  
  `PUT /api/incidents/{id}/status`
- Each update triggers an **`IncidentStatusChanged`** event published to **NATS**.

---

### 3. Notifications
- **NotificationService** subscribes to the following events:
  - `IncidentReported`
  - `IncidentStatusChanged`
- It can:
  - Log or simulate sending notifications (email/SMS)  
  - Track notification delivery  
- Communication is **event-driven only** ‚Äî no direct REST calls between services.

---

### 4. Query (Read Model)
- **QueryService** subscribes to events and maintains a read-optimized database.
- Exposes REST endpoints:
  - `GET /api/incidents`
  - `GET /api/incidents/{id}`
- The read model may include:
  - Number of incidents per category  
  - Average response/resolution time  
  - Historical trends  

---

### 5. Reliability and Integration
- **NATS** ensures reliable, asynchronous communication between services.  
- If a service is temporarily unavailable, messages are re-delivered when it reconnects (JetStream can be added later).  
- Each service is independent and horizontally scalable.

---

### 6. Testability
- **IncidentService** is developed using a **test-first** approach (unit and integration tests).  
- **QueryService** and **NotificationService** are tested using simulated NATS events.  
- Frontend is optional and can be added later.

---

## üß© Non-Functional Requirements
- API documentation via **Swagger / OpenAPI**  
- Logging using **Serilog** or built-in .NET logging  
- **Docker** is used for running NATS and other dependencies  
- Architecture pattern: **CQRS + Event-Driven Microservices**  
- Code structure supports future extensions (analytics, dashboards, etc.)

---

## üß± Technologies
- **.NET 8 / ASP.NET Core**
- **C#**
- **NATS Messaging**
- **MSSQL (local)**
- **xUnit / NUnit** (for testing)
- **Docker** (for NATS)
- **Swagger** (for API documentation)

## üì¶ Services Overview

| Service | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **IncidentService** | REST API | Handles incident creation and status updates, publishes events |
| **NotificationService** | Worker | Subscribes to events and sends notifications |
| **QueryService** | REST API | Builds and exposes a read model from events |
| **Common** | Library | Shared models, DTOs, and event definitions |

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Initialize the solution and all projects (`IncidentService`, `NotificationService`, `QueryService`, `Common`)  
2. Configure **NATS** (via Docker)  
3. Implement event publishing/subscribing  
4. Add **unit tests** for each service  
5. Extend functionality gradually (analytics, dashboards, etc.)

---

üß† **Goal:**  
Build a realistic, modular system that demonstrates **clean architecture, event-driven design, and testable service boundaries**, while serving a socially useful purpose.
